# 🎨 Turtle Graphics Fun

A colorful and creative Python project that utilizes Turtle Graphics to draw random color paths and a spirograph! This project showcases two scripts: one for random movement in different directions with vibrant colors and another for generating a mesmerizing spirograph pattern.

## 📜 Project Overview

This project includes:
1. **Random Color Walk** (in `main.py`): A turtle that moves randomly on the screen, changing colors and directions.
2. **Spirograph** (in `spiro.py`): A beautiful spirograph generated by looping a turtle in a circle with random colors.

### 🎨 Features

- Uses Python's Turtle Graphics and `random` libraries.
- Draws randomly colored patterns on the screen.
- Creates a spirograph with adjustable settings for unique designs.
